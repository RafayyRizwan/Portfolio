                    I carefully considered several design components when creating my portfolio website in order to
                    provide it a polished and expert look. I choose light blue and gray as my color palette in an
                    attempt to create an eye-catching environment that would help me properly showcase my work. In
                    order to improve user navigation and engagement, keyframe animations and grid layout approaches
                    were used to create a dynamic and engaging experience.
                 </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, I maintained more than 15 commits and integrated GitHub with 3 branches to provide
                    strong version control. This not only highlights my ability to work well in a team environment
                    but also my commitment to continuously improving and upgrading my project.

                    </p>
                   <p>
                    I used the Roboto typeface to bring a bit of elegance to the entire design while maintaining a
                    modern and sophisticated style.Using principles from my beginning software engineering semester
                    and modern portfolio websites, I painstakingly created wireframes to direct the development
                    process and guarantee coherence and functioning all the way through.
                   </p>

                    <p>
                        Apart from exhibiting my work, I also included my résumé with ease and included connections to
                    my social media accounts on GitHub, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other platforms. I improved the
                    user experience by adding the "target blank" element, which made it possible for visitors to
                    browse my portfolio and quickly access external sites without interfering with their surfing.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Ensuring a smooth user interface with a focus on simplicity of use and accessibility was my top
                    objective during the development process. By including these components, my portfolio website
                    provides a coherent and interesting experience for visitors while acting as a thorough depiction
                    of my abilities and accomplishments.
